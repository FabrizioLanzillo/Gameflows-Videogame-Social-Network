Protagonist Aoba Seragaki lives on the island and works at a store named Junk Shop Mediocrity (\u5e73\u51e1, Heibon), hoping to live a simple life. However, after being forcefully dragged into the popular cyber game Rhyme (\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0, Raimu) with its virtual world and its use of Allmates (\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30e1\u30a4\u30c8, \u014cru Meito), mobile devices that usually appear as if they are the owner's pets, and hearing rumors about disappearances involving Ribstiez (\u30ea\u30d6\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30ba, Ribusut\u012bzu), turf wars between groups, all semblance of a peaceful life for Aoba ends.",
