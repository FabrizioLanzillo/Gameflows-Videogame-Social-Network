  "selftext": "I really wanted to like this game. But I felt like it missed the mark. The card mechanics aren't as interesting or fleshed out as something like Slay the Spire. And the Auto-chess aspect I feel is ruined by the constant micromanaging from the player, which I feel works actively against the purpose of auto-chess. \n\nWith that said however, this game does have a bunch of interesting ideas. Does anyone know of a similar game? I've really been struggling to find a good auto-chess/auto-battler that is PvE.",
