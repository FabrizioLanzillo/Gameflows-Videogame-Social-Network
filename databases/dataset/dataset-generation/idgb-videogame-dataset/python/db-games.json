    "name": "Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures",
    "summary": "Based on the events and characters of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Cimmerian stories, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures is a fantasy themed massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that immerses players in a dark, expansive universe filled with ground-breaking brutal combat, dangerously intoxicating magical abilities, and the social and cooperative game features that MMORPG players crave.\n\nSet in the later years of Conan's life, after he has famously become king by his own hand, the game centers around the fragile state of Conan's rule in Aquilonia. Surrounded by enemies and hostile nations, Conan's rule hangs by a thread and in the end, it's up to players, either singly or backed by their guilds to turn the tide for or against the embattled king.\n\nMassively Multiplayer Gaming for the Adult Player: One of the most highly anticipated MMORPGs in recent years due to the strength and familiarity of the Conan franchise across a variety of major media, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures is the first of several releases planned for the franchise, all of which are aimed at an adult audience. Firmly rooted in the savage, bloody, violent and sexy Hyborian universe, players can expect a graphically beautiful game blended with gritty gameplay that is true to both the barbarian hero from Howard?s writings and the Schwarzenegger influenced version from books, movies and comics.\n\nAvailable Cultures and Classes: Although Age of Conan contains a wide range of peoples, its playable cultures are currently limited to Aquilonians, Cimmerians, and Stygians. Within each of these players can choose from a selection of archetypal character classes, although available classes and subsequent subclasses are not necessarily the same within each culture. For example, archetypal classes for Aquilonians and Cimmerians are Rogue, Priest and Soldier, while Stygians are represented by Rogue, Priest and Mage. Further differences exist within subclasses for each. See the basic breakdown of all three cultures below:\n\nAquilonians: Internally divided, but united against their barbarian neighbors, the Aquilonians live lives on the edge. Their kingdom, with its prosperous cities, enlightened culture and religious freedom, is known as the \"Flower of the West.\" Yet for all this and despite the power of King, Conan I, it is a land where culture clashes and unrest are always a threat.\n\nCimmerians: As the Hyborian Age comes to an end the northern barbarian clans of the Cimmerians know that the end of their time is drawing near too. King Conan I of Aquilonia is himself a Cimmerian, though not typical of his people. Although his life has been filled with wanderlust, his Kin care nothing for what occurs outside their clan territories.\n\nStygians: Masters of the magical arts and ruled by their consuming worship of the serpent-god Set, the Stygians excel at occult and diabolic lore. They learned long ago that true power lies in knowledge and in pacts with dark powers. This single-mindedness has allowed them become the only culture to harness the secrets of the Mage class and power that comes with it.\n\nModes Singleplayer as well as Multiplayer: Unlike most MMORPGs, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures includes a significant singleplayer experience as well as deep overarching multiplayer gameplay. This is an atypical MMORPG feature, but one that has a purpose. Players enter the game as a lowly galley slave with no memory of his/her past, and over the first five to 20 levels of singleplayer action build the skills necessary to survive in the game's multiplayer levels. During this time you will traverse a variety of rich environments including jungles, deserts, mountains, valleys, dungeons and cities packed with NPCs, beasts and monsters, before eventually leveling up and moving back to your chosen culture?s homeland. Because the only character-related choices that players have to make at the game?s opening are their looks, clothing and culture, this singleplayer mode is important in deciding what class and subclass to pursue and thus the level of impact your character will have in greater multiplayer portions of the game.\n\nIn-game levels 20 and above are strictly multiplayer. 20-40 introduce players to guilds. 40-60 deal with large scale combat. 60-80 have the player interacting with King Conan and levels 80 and up represent end-game play. Here gameplay changes as social aspects of MMORPG gameplay take over on a large scale.\n\nReal-time Combat That Takes Queues from the FPS: Traditionally MMORPGs have utilized a mix of auto and turn-based functionality in their combat systems, but Age of Conan dispenses with that, instead drawing inspiration from FPS/action games. Firmly rooted in the brutality of the Hyborian universe, game developer Funcom has devised an action-based system that not only provides the sense of actually being in the fight, but also requires the player to participate in it. That means no simple targeted attacks. Players can attack and defend from nearly any position in real-time, whether on the ground or atop a mount, while standing still or on the move. It?s a recipe for carnage and one that fits right into the world of Conan.\n\nThe combat system in Age of Conan comes in three forms: drunken brawling, mini games like CTF and massive Player vs. Player battles, which lets you engage in siege combat to defend or attack a city. All are easy to learn, but difficult to master, providing hours worth of play and replay value and are the core of this new cutting edge MMORPG.",

Since LittleBigPlanet 2, the game has expanded to being a \"platform for games\" with the introduction of numerous mini-games and other genres into the game diversifying the game from being strictly a traditional platformer. Most LittleBigPlanet games involve a player playing solo or co-operatively with friends to navigate through a level whilst collecting various \"bubbles\" along the way. These bubbles come in two types, small ones which constitute points and larger ones that contain new costumes, stickers or other types of collectibles that can be used to customize Sackboy or create levels. There are also numerous co-operative parts of levels whereby certain prize bubbles can only be collected with the help of at least one player or more depending on the number of players stated in the level.",

    "summary": "There was a time long ago when Elves wandered the world in great numbers, when their achievements outshone even the brightness of the sun, when human and dwarven civilizations were still in their infancies. There was a time of legends and heroes, of incredible accomplishments and great deeds, a time when the world knew true grandeur. That time is long gone, however, crushed under the heel of fate and decay. The Elves are gone, now, victims to their own delusions. They failed to heed the warnings of the Harbinger, the one who came to warn them...\n\nHe arrived on the night the moons and the Centaur constellation were aligned, several millenia ago, his appearance foul and nightmarish, and warned all who would listen of the impending doom that lay ahead. He issued warnings and prophecies, but the Elves had grown vain and arrogant, and heeded him not. The Harbinger left, promising to return when the time would be right again.\n\nSeveral generations later-a short time by Elven reckoning-the Harbinger returned, once more treading under an alignment of the moons and constellations. The Elves had all but forgotten his past warnings. As the Curse fell upon their race, they stood defenseless. Despite their arcane lore and magical skills, they could not resist the godly powers that crushed them. When the Harbinger left their lands, there was not a single building standing. It is said that the winds carried the stench of death even as far as the Dwarven villages in the north. The latter took this for a sign that evil was coming, and prepared to defend themselves. When the Harbinger came to their lands to warn them too that their turn would come, that great danger lay ahead, they grew fearful of the visitor's appearance, and shunned him. He left them, warning them that achievements alone were not the measure of a worthy people.\n\nA millenia later, the skies repeated their fateful alignment of moons and stars. The Dwarves had flourished into a society of craftsmen and artisans. They had built great cities and were dutifully worshiping their god. Prophecies from long ago warned them against a fate similar to that of the Elves, so they had taken care to properly groom themselves and prepare for the Third Coming. When the Harbinger came to\nthem, however, they could not stand the sight and smell of him, and, mistaking him for some fiend from hell, immediately struck him down. This, historians say, was the very act that caused the downfall of the Dwarves. They also say that some humans witnessed the event, and that the Harbinger warned them as well, that he told them they too would be judged, lest their worthiness was greater than that of the Elves and the Dwarves.\n\nNow, it may be that none of this tale is true, that we are but a worried people living under an unusual alignment of stars, one which has not occurred in a thousand years, but maybe, just maybe, there is some truth to this tale. Maybe there really is a Harbinger that is walking the land even as we speak, walking towards us to judge us and torment us if we fail him. So, little scoundrel, before I kill you for your crimes, before I condemn your soul to everlasting fire, answer me this one question.",

Though the shotgun is Max's weapon of choice, ammo is scarce, and so melee options are the smarter way to go. The 'thunderstick' is an explosive weapon that can be lanced into an enemy's chest, crackling like a lit dynamite fuse before blowing the victim to smithereens. The Harpoon is also one of Max's favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max's Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies's vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features. \n \nMad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max's garage can also be used to change and modify the car's engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the \u201cshell\u201d of the auto-mobile and the car\u2019s weight and attributes update accordingly.

It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.\n\nThe game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.\n\nThe melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.\n\nA unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.",

Based upon the gameplay of the Age of Empires series, it was originally developed by Robot Entertainment, but on February 24, 2011, Gas Powered Games, took over production. The game was published by Microsoft. \n \nThe game was free-to-play\u2014it was free for users to play, though premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to special items and blueprints, and more quests and features. \n \nOn March 27, 2012, the game premiered on Steam after a major overhaul patch which addressed complaints of an \"MMO-like grind\" and many other features, along with the debut of the Celtic civilization. On June 15, 2012 the premium content system was changed to offer the option to purchase all past and future content through \"Empire points\" earned in game, or by purchasing the points directly with real world money. \n \nAs of January 3, 2013, Microsoft ceased further development on the game. A Microsoft representative later announced on the forums that on August 22, 2013, the Games for Windows \u2013 Live Marketplace would be shut down, leaving the game only accessible by current or former players. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014 when the service would be shut down. The closure was due to the content being too expensive to maintain. \n \nIn 2017, Age of Empires Online was reestablished using Microsoft's publicly released developer-kit for the game and is now hosted on a server emulator known as \"Project Celeste\". The game can be played for free in single-player and multiplayer mode with all online features fully enabled. In May 2019, the team announced that they are developing Microsoft's unreleased Roman civilization for play based upon all known data of the civilization before the official servers were closed. It was finalized and released on March 14th, 2021",

It is a variation on their browser game Candy Crush.\n\nDifferent \"special candies\" can be formed by matching a combination of 4 or 5 in a certain formation, such as a \"Striped\" candy (which clears either an entire row or column), a \"Wrapped\" candy (which acts like a bomb; clearing the 8 surrounding candies, falling, and exploding one more time), or a \"Color Bomb\" (which removes all candies with the same color of the one it is matched with). Special Candies can also be matched together, producing varying effects; for example, matching a color bomb with a striped candy turns all of the candies of its color into striped candies, which are immediately detonated.\n\nOther special candies which appear on the boards for free can be purchased from the in-game store, or won from the Candy Crush Booster Wheel. These include Jelly Fish in jelly clearing boards which clear 3 pieces from the board at random, the Coconut Wheel on ingredient dropping boards which changes three candies in a row into striped candies, and Lucky Candy in recipe boards which when matched change to one of the types of pieces the player needs to clear the objective. The Booster Wheel also offers a chance to win a jackpot of all boosters in one spin.\n\nOther pieces known as Blockers appear on boards to add to the challenge: Icing (also called Meringues) cannot be moved and can only be removed by matching next to it, Liquorice Locks cage of single pieces of candy to prevent them from use, Chocolate pieces will multiply if not cleared, Liquorice Swirls cannot be removed with Special Candies, Candy Bombs will explode and end the level early if they are not cleared, Multilayered Icing requires multiple matches to remove, Chocolate Spawners will produce Chocolate pieces at all times, Marmalade guards Special Candies from use, Cake Bombs can clear the entire board once cleared, and Toffee Tornadoes move on the board destroying pieces and shattering the tile beneath them to prevent use for one turn. Other pieces also appear on levels such as Chameleon Candies which switch colors every turn, Mystery Candies which randomly turn into a Special Candy or a Blocker, and Extra Time Candies on time limit levels.\n\nThe player can also purchase various Boosters to attempt to win levels more easily or extend play after a lost level; Lollipop Hammer clears a single piece from the board, Extra Moves can be purchased if running out of moves at the end of a game, Free Switch allows players to switch two pieces that do not possibly match, Sweet Teeth to clear out Blockers and Jelly, Bomb Coolers to add onto Candy Bomb timers if the timer runs out, and the Bubblegum Troll to stop Chocolate Spawners from spawning chocolate from its sides.

    "summary": "For the last twelve months, we\u2019ve had our heads down working hard on Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture and it\u2019s really exciting to be able to share some more information with you as well as a new trailer.\n\nIf you already know The Chinese Room, you\u2019ll know that we make story-driven games. Creating a rich, deep world with strong drama and exceptional production values is key to what we\u2019re all about. Rapture is set in a remote valley in June 1984 and is a story about people and how they live with each other. But it\u2019s also about the end of the world.\n\nRapture is inspired by the fiction of John Wyndham, J. G. Ballard, John Christopher and other authors who deal with ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. There\u2019s a very particular English feel that we wanted to capture in the game, a combination of the epic and the intimate. Rapture also came from our obsession with post-apocalyptic gaming, and the simple idea that whilst we normally play as the hero, in reality, most of us would be the piles of ash and bone littering the game world. That\u2019s an interesting place to start telling a story.\n\nOur approach is to create a game that you can utterly immerse yourself in. Yaughton Valley, where Rapture takes place, is a living, breathing world. The world of Rapture is not just a backdrop; it\u2019s a character in its own right. It\u2019s great working with PS4 as its processing power makes a game like this possible for a team our size.\n\nThe game is all about discovery. It\u2019s open-world so you have the freedom to explore wherever you like, visiting areas in an order you define, and the story is written to allow this whilst making sure every player has a strong dramatic experience. It\u2019s a type of storytelling that is completely unique to games. The choices you make as a player have a direct impact on how you understand the story \u2013 the more you explore and interact, the deeper you are drawn into Rapture\u2019s world.",

More than 2 million units were shipped worldwide a month after its debut, rendering it a commercial success.

    "summary": "Mari0 is a fan-made video game that combines elements of the video games Super Mario Bros and Portal. The game was developed by Maurice Gu\u00e9gan of Stabyourself.net, who has previously worked on parody games such as Not Tetris. Mari0 was developed with the L\u00d6VE framework, and is cross-platform. The game was released on March 3, 2012 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux under a Creative Commons license (BY-NC-SA). The source code is also available to download.\nThe core game of Mari0 plays directly from the 8-bit Super Mario Bros. 2D platform game, where the player controls Mario via the keyboard, running and jumping through levels, avoiding or jumping on enemies to defeat them, while collecting coins to earn points towards their score. The game adds the concept of the \"portal gun\" from the Portal series; the player can click with the mouse device on two separate surfaces on the level to create a portal between them. This can be used for a number of gameplay options, often using vertical momentum entering one portal to \"fling\" the Mario character horizontally out of the other portal, but will also affect enemies and other game elements in similar manners.\nThe core game uses the level designs from the original Super Mario Bros. as well as sets of test chambers inspired by Portal '\u200bs Aperture Science, but a level editor, along with different graphic sets and shaders are provided to create new content. Up to four players can cooperatively play in the game. Online multiplayer is to be released in a future version.",

In a disorganized and ghostly city, those foolish, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain\u2019s most elusive predators: the vampires. Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline.\n\nExplore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don\u2019t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street...\n\nBe careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you \"alive\"; it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use.\n\nThere will be times when exploration and seduction will only get you so far, and you'll need to resort to engaging in Vampyr's dynamic real-time combat. It blends hard-hitting melee combat with ranged shooting mechanics and the supernatural vampire powers. You'll face many types of enemies: different species of vampires and creatures, as well as vampire hunters who want to hunt you down with their weapons, tools and traps. In Vampyr, your health and the \"energy\" that drives your supernatural powers are one and same! Using powers will drain your own blood, giving you an edge in battle but also leaving you weaker. You will have to find a way to feed during combat to replenish your strength.\n\nVampyr also offers a deep crafting system. Find and loot materials and components from the fresh corpses of your victims or during exploration, in order to craft and improve tools, melee and ranged weapons, as well as special ammunitions and coating to exploit the weaknesses of your enemies.\n\nAs you cling to what remains of your humanity, your decisions will ultimately shape the fate of your hero while searching for answers in the coughing, foggy aftermath of the Spanish Flu.",

Players can choose between a variety of classes, with ten classes released and an upcoming one, as of May 2014. The players can freely customize their character or avatar with many choices of hair styles and faces and much more. It is then proceeded with the choice of four Eidolons, who will accompany the player throughout the game, while also giving the ability to earn other Eidolons.\nWithin the game, the player can interact with many non-player characters and enter combat mode with monsters outside of the hub world. The combat system is primarily the player using a wide variety of skills corresponding with the class against the monsters, who also have their own set of skills. The majority of the game is to simply attack and defeat the monsters along the way while partaking quests. The combat system is unique in a way that, although the player has to click on a monster to engage in combat, the player also has the ability to move to dodge and use their skills in a variety of ways. With an accompanying Eidolon, the player's Eidolon can also fight alongside their character, and also use a combination attack. The combat system is not merely a \"click-and-watch\" combat. Outside of the combat system, the player can also engage in several different tasks, such as fishing, crafting, and many more.\n\nWhile the game is situated in a free-to-play environment, the game also allows the players to purchase Aeria Points, or for short AP, that allows the players to use that monetary value for special in-game items found in the Item Mall. Otherwise, the game uses the gold and silver tactic, which can be acquired a number of ways. The game also allows the use of trade, a self-installed stall in Navea, and the Auction House. Players can also use the mailing system to mail other players using the cash-on-delivery system.",

Progress in the game is measured by the number of \"mind units\" (MUs), i.e. people nominally controlled by each faction (as illustrated on the Intel Map). The necessary links between portals may range from feet/meters to miles/kilometers or hundreds of miles/kilometers in operations of considerable logistical complexity. International links and fields are not uncommon, as Ingress has attracted an enthusiastic following in cities worldwide amongst both young and old, to the extent that the gameplay is itself a lifestyle for some, including tattoos.",

You control a unique car that allows you to boost, jump, rotate, and even fly through a chaotic and twisted city. The world has a mysterious history, and as you explore you'll be able to uncover pieces of its past.\n\nThe roads are treacherous and unpredictable with obstacles around every corner. Instead of doing laps on a loop, you'll be trying to survive to the end in the quickest time. Since your car has several abilities, it allows you to not only drive fast on the track but also upside down and on buildings and walls! You can also fly to discover new shortcuts and paths. You'll be able to take on the roads alone, or in multiplayer with your friends!\n\nThe game is a spiritual successor to the multi-award winning game Nitronic Rush, created by ourselves and 6 others while attending DigiPen Institute of Technology. It was widely praised for its innovative mechanics, visual style, audio design, and atmosphere.\nKey Features\nAbilities: The cars can perform many unique actions such as boosting, jumping, flying, and rotating to navigate along and around the track.\nAdventure: A single player experience to learn how to play the game as well as unveil a short story about the world's mysterious past.\nMultiplayer: LAN, Online, and Split-Screen play in several modes, such as Sprint as well as Reverse Tag, Stunt, and many others.\nLevel editor: Includes a powerful level editor that can be used to create levels from inside the game and share them with players around the world using Steam Workshop.\nOriginal soundtrack: New music from the composer behind award-winning games like Nitronic Rush, Solace, and The Fourth Wall.",

    "summary": "Starsiege takes place in the 29th century, portraying the conflict between humanity and the artificially intelligent Cybrid war machines. Played out in various locations throughout the solar system, the story examines both civil unrest in the colonies and an all-or-nothing genocidal invasion by the machines. Bipedal mecha known as HERCs are the mainstay of ground-based combat, and the focus of gameplay.\nHumanity is nominally united in an interplanetary Empire, led from Earth by the Immortal Emperor Solomon Petresun. Petresun's policy is the defence of Earth at all costs. While Earth is prosperous and well protected, the colonies on Luna, Mars, and Venus suffer from increasingly harsh regulations and production quotas. The combat units of the Empire are represented by the Imperial Police, Terran Defense Force and the Imperial Knights. The former paramilitary group is responsible for maintaining order in the colonies. The Terran Defense Force are the standard military with bases from Mercury to Titan. The Knights, led by Grand Master Caanon Weathers, are the military's elite and are provided with the best pilots and equipment.\nThe inequality between the colonies and Earth foments rebellion. In 2802 there are two guerilla movements on Mars, one that concentrates on destroying and capturing Imperial infrastructure and supplies and another bent on killing Imperial personnel and sympathizers. Both groups operate from underground bases and make do with modified mining HERCs and tanks. The rebels partially offset their disadvantages with superior weapons taken from the alien \"Tharsis Cache\"; an underground stockpile of alien technology discovered by rebels while digging new tunnels. Eventually the rebellion becomes too great for the police to contain and the Knights are deployed to Mars to crush the insurrection.\nThe Cybrids are a race of sentient robots responsible for the first Earthsiege. They are led by the first Cybrid, Prometheus, who is revered with god-like status. The Cybrids established themselves in the outer solar system after being defeated two centuries before during the first Earthsiege. Since then they have built up their strength for another bid to destroy humanity and claim Earth for their own. Like the Martian rebels, the Cybrids discover their own cache of alien weapons and adapt it to use, but their cache is inferior to the Tharsis Cache.\nThe game offers two story campaigns, with different endings. The Human campaign puts the player in control of a Martian rebel, initially fighting the Empire before humanity unites against the Cybrid invasion midway through the campaign. The human campaign culminates in an attack on Prometheus on Pluto. The Cybrid campaign starts with their invasion across the outer colonies and proceeds to Earth, ending in an assault on the Imperial palace to kill Petresun.",

This means the game must be downloaded/installed and started in Japanese before switching to English. \n \nGranblue Fantasy is a Japanese role-playing video game. The game plays as a traditional Japanese role-playing video game with turn-based battles. The game also contains summons and a class system that alters the main character's move-set and growth. Characters gain levels and abilities by accruing experience; summons and weapons equipped also confer characters with bonuses on attack power and HP. The characters themselves are gained either via quests (the main story quests or special event quests) or by using in-game currency to receive random crystal fragments, which may contain special weapons that add specific characters to the party. Characters, summons, and weapons are ranked (from best to worst) as SSR, SR, R, or N; each is also of type wind, water, fire, earth, light, or darkness. Voice actors provide voices for all of the characters in battle, and for much of the main and event storylines.",

    "summary": "\"No Place for Bravery is an atmospheric minimalist roguelike where you play as a group of adventurers wandering through an eerie, devastated high fantasy world on a quest to slay the godlike entities that brought down humankind.\n\nIt is basically an action RPG with super neat, Hyper Light Drifter inspired pixel art, minimalist controls, procedurally generated maps and a time manipulation mechanic similar to Super Time Force's that lets the player control more than one character simultaneously by playing with one character and then rewinding time and playing with another character alongside the first one: not only the player has to plan every move, he also has to synchronize everything.\n\nBravery is, like many other roguelikes, filled with unique random events. The idea is to use these events to craft the game\u2019s mythology. The game doesn't use regular exposition to tell it's story, rather, the player will absorb the nuances of Bravery\u2019s narrative by exploring its gorgeous environment, experiencing the aesthetics of its mechanics or by simply making sense of the vast array of mysterious random events.\n\nAlso, the game gets rid of all the grinding: Skinner Box mechanics and ''artificial'' stats-based progression have no place here: I'm talking about a game with absolutely no numbers and very, very few written words.\n\nNo Place for Bravery is an extremely hard and completely skill and strategy based game. The world is to be relentless, and the player feels the mediocrity before such a world in each step that is taken.\"",

The protagonists will form teams in order to fight through Chaos' armies and find their crystals which will later be used to destroy Chaos. Each character has his own campaign to go through at the end of which a crystal will be collected. \n \nThe game also features a single fight and an arcade mode where the player will be able to choose his fighter and the opponent (opponents are automatically chosen by the game if playing in arcade mode though). All of the character's experience and skills received through the campaign are saved for the other game modes (and vice-versa, for example: if Cloud had a level equal to 12 when completing the campaign, he will also appear to have the same level when viewing him in the character roster in Arcade or Quick Battle mode). \n \nAnother feature is that the items you find during the campaign belong to you, the player. That means you can move items from a character to another. The game also features extra content such as villains, costumes etc. which can be unlocked by using PP.

As you help the local people and establish a reputation in Colorado, quests and narrative will force you to make decisions on how to lead. \n- The game will be set in the savage lands of frozen Colorado, where survival is difficult and a happy outcome is never guaranteed. Players will face difficult moral choices and make sacrifices that will change the game world. \n- Wasteland 3 will feature a deep and engaging story utilizing a newly-revamped dialog tree system from the celebrated writers of Torment: Tides of Numenera. \n- Simultaneously releasing to Windows, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.",

It is an unofficial, enhanced remake of Nintendo's Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991), borrowing the art style and overall feeling of the Game Boy Advance game Metroid: Zero Mission (2004). Shortly after the game's release, Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting AM2R; download links to the game were removed from its official website, but Guasti said that he still planned to continue working on the game privately. In September 2016, Guasti ended the development of AM2R after he received a DMCA takedown request from Nintendo.\n\nThe game follows Samus Aran, who aims to eradicate the parasitic Metroids from their home planet SR388. It includes several new features, including redone graphics and music, a map system, and new areas and minibosses. The controls were changed to be less \"floaty\", in line with the gameplay of later titles in the series. Video game journalists appreciated the game, frequently calling it impressive and commenting on the improved visuals compared to those of the original Metroid II, although one thought the conditions required to win battles against Metroids were too specific considering how often they occur. The game was nominated for The Game Awards 2016, but was later removed from the nominations page without notice.",

Compared to other real-time strategy games, it has a greater focus on artillery, radar, and counter-battery technologies, more frequent in-game cinematic updates as game play progresses, a massive research tree, as well as a vehicle design system.\n\nOutside of the story, Warzone 2100 only has a single faction. This limits some of the variety that can be expected from real-time strategy games, although the single faction is very complex. Essentially, Warzone 2100 plays much like Earth 2150 with 3D units and terrain, customizable vehicles, a lack of traditional infantry, use of \"research\" to acquire new technologies, and the differentiation of vehicles types.",

The game is a combination between a shooter and a sports simulator, with 3D anime graphics and techno soundtrack.\n\nThe game has no background story. Players just connect to a virtual world where they have to prove their skills while advancing through all the 100 levels (Beginner, Rookie, Super Rookie, Semi Pro, Pro, S1, S2, S3, S4 - Master), based on the amount of experience points they have gathered after each game played. The player can create up to three characters of either gender. Before players can start a game, the character must have equipped at least one weapon and one skill. Players can choose between close-range, mid-range, long-range (sniping), mental, throwing, and support weapons. Players can also choose between active or passive Skills.\n\nCostumes, items, weapons and skills can be bought from the game shop with PEN or AP. PEN is virtual money, earned by playing matches, while AP is earned by paying real money (multiple methods, from credit cards to mobile text messages, specific to each country). Costumes, items, weapons and skills can be permanent or rented (hour-based or day-based). Permanent stuff needs repairs after each use, rented stuff doesn't. Day-based items follow the real life time, while hour-based items count only when playing.\n\nAfter players create and equip their characters with items purchased from the shop, they are ready to join a server based on country/language, and then join a room based on Game Mode. A room can have maximum 12 players connected: 6 players in Alpha Team and 6 players in Beta Team.\n\nThere are various modes in the game:\nIn Touchdown Mode , the most played game mode, players must take a yellow, bouncing ball called \"fumbi\", run with it to the other side of the map and put it in the red goalpost. Fumbi can be carried by multiple teammates along the way.\n\nIn Deathmatch Mode, players must kill each other in order to take their team to victory before the time ends.\n\nIn Chaser, a virus takes control over a player who gets overpowered and who must kill the other players in the time left.\n\nIn Captain Mode, all players have crowns over their heads which gives them a large amount of hit points. Each team must eliminate all the enemies with crowns in order to win or at least have more teammates with crowns alive when the time runs out.\n\nIn Battle Royal, players must kill each other (no teams here). The player with the highest score is marked as a target (targets change all the time in a BR match).\n\nIn Arcade Mode, players follow a story of the game where they must kill the virtual bots and finish all the given missions, structured in chapters.\n\nPlayers can also join Clans and play Clan Matches.",

We've put years of time and effort into this release and hope you enjoy it. \n \nWhat is Falcon 4.0? \n \nIf you're new to Falcon 4.0, (\"F4\" for short), F4 is a combat flight simulator originally developed and released December 12, 1998 by MicroProse. It models the Lockheed-Martin F-16C Block 50/52 in a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula. F4 has been popular among combat sim pilots due to its dynamic war campaign engine, detailed aircraft avionics, and multi-player capabilities. Continual development of the simulation by community members has allowed F4 to live on years after the MicroProse studios were shut down and official development of the sim ceased. \n \nWho are we? \n \nBenchmark Sims is one of the few remaining F4 development groups comprised of \"community members\". Our first beta release for an F4 mod was in September of 2003. We've done our best to add still more improvements to F4 in the meanwhile. \"Falcon BMS\" is now the official name of our community mod for the original Falcon 4.0. \n \nWhat have we accomplished? \n \nBMS has worked on an array of features and our goal with the articles is to try and bring back that same excitement the old MicroProse developer's notes gave us all years ago. We could just say something like \"we've coded a new flight model\" but without any documentation, there would be no appreciation as to just how difficult it was, how long it took to get right, or how detailed it is. We think some of our features will make your jaw drop--it does ours! Some of those features include: \n \nGraphics \n3d cockpit \nTerrain engine \nMulti-player code improvements \nFlight modeling and physics \nArtificial Intelligence \nAvionics \nSound engine \nUser Interface \nAirbase modeling \nWeather modeling \n \nAnd more! \n \n-The Benchmark Sims Team",

You'll earn some gems that you can use to unlock new cards, but it's back to the drawing board after that.

If you combine your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger.\n\n\u2013 Exploration \u2013\nMost of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets.

Supraland respects your lifetime and doesn\u2019t bloat the playtime with unlimited no-brainer collectibles.\n\n\u2013 Puzzle Design \u2013\nThe deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative puzzles you\u2019ve never seen anywhere before, encouraging you to stop and think about what abilities you have and how you can use them in yet another way. Puzzle types that I already knew from other games were immediately rejected in the design process.

It has been in the works since 1998 and is currently nearing completion, though several parts of the game are still missing.\n\nSonic Robo Blast 2 is closely inspired by the original 2D Sonic games for the Genesis and attempts to recreate a game with this style in 3D, though it also borrows elements from the current Sonic games, such as Sonic's signature Air Spin Attack. Entirely original to SRB2 is its Multiplayer mode, a variation of classic first-person shooter games with Sonic elements. Due to being built with a modified Doom Legacy engine, the game is also very easily customizable. Custom levels, characters and even source code modifications can be created with the help of external editors.",
